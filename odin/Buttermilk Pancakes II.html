                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
                        <li>½ cup milk</li>
                        <li>3 eggs</li>
                        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Directions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>STEP 1</h3>
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook. </li>
                            <h3>STEP 2</h3>   
                        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>
                            <h3>STEP 3</h3>
                        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together. Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
                    </ul>
